# Data Engineer Position Test Repository

This repository contains my solutions for the data engineer position test. Below is an outline of the tasks provided and my corresponding work:

## Algorithm Tests
I have completed:
- `test_1.py`
- `test_2.py`
- `test_3.py`
- `test_4.py`

## Data Engineer Skill Tests
I have completed:
- `data_analysis_test.ipynb`
- `data_cleansing_and_transformation_test.ipynb`

## Setup Database Task
I provided the following files for this task:
- `create_table.sql`: SQL script for creating database tables.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker configuration file for setting up the database environment.
- `elt_process.py`: Script implementing the ETL process.

## Incremental Data Load Task
The files for this task are provided in the `/incremental_data_load_test` directory.

## Complex Data Transformation with Aggregation
The files for this task are provided in the `/complex_data_transformation_test` directory.

### Notes:
- For the last two tasks (Increamental.. and Complex..), I used SQLite as the database and a GUI tool to help me work with database operations.
- While working on Docker-related configurations, I honestly relied heavily on ChatGPT to guide me. Although I'm still learning about Docker, I ensured that the tasks run properly by testing the database setup in Docker, and it works without any issues.
- I am committed to learning and improving in areas where I currently lack familiarity, such as Docker and related technologies.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward for your response. :)
